# A Postman collection of Azure Cognitive Services APIs

[Link to the public Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/devrain/workspace/devrain/collection/6348787-f114d6c6-b81f-4e26-acd2-502dcc21bdf5?ctx=documentation)

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based services with REST APIs and client library SDKs available to help you build cognitive intelligence into your applications. You can add cognitive features to your applications without having artificial intelligence (AI) or data science skills. Azure Cognitive Services comprise various AI services that enable you to build cognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, understand, and even make decisions.

The catalog of cognitive services that provide cognitive understanding are categorized into five main pillars: Vision, Speech, Language, Decision, Search.

This collection contains common Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services APIs to be used from Postman.

Services which are currently supported are: Content Moderator, Computer Vision, Custom Vision, Face, Form Recognizer, Language Understanding, Translator, QnA Maker.

## Content Moderator

The Azure Content Moderator API is a cognitive service that checks text, image, and video content for material that is potentially offensive, risky, or otherwise undesirable. When such material is found, the service applies appropriate labels (flags) to the content. Your app can then handle flagged content in order to comply with regulations or maintain the intended environment for users.

## Computer Vision

The cloud-based Computer Vision API provides developers with access to advanced algorithms for processing images and returning information. By uploading an image or specifying an image URL, Microsoft Computer Vision algorithms can analyze visual content in different ways based on inputs and user choices.

## Custom Vision

Custom Vision lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, based on their visual characteristics.

## Face

The Azure Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images. Facial recognition software is important in many different scenarios, such as security, natural user interface, image content analysis and management, mobile apps, and robotics.

## Form Recognizer

Form Recognizer is a cognitive service that uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents. It then outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file. Unsupervised learning allows the model to understand the layout and field data without manual data labeling or intensive coding. You can also do supervised learning with manually labeled data. Models trained with labeled data can perform better and can work with more complicated documents.

## Language Understanding

Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

## Translator

Translator is a cloud-based machine translation service supporting more than 70 languages. Translator can be used to build applications, websites, tools, or any solution requiring multi-language support.

## QnA Maker

QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data. It is used to find the most appropriate answer for any input from your custom knowledge base (KB) of information. QnA Maker is commonly used to build conversational client applications, which include social media applications, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop applications.
